# Scuba App
A simple dive log app

This app uses the Foodtracker app template (Apple's "Getting Started" tutorial for Swift) and adds additional features relevant to a scuba diving log app. This project is used as practice with the Swift language and gaining familiarity with iOS development and Xcode.

There is a basic table view containing a list of dive log entries, an editable dive log entry page, and an add entry page presented modally. Navigation Controller is used to facilitate presenting segues, and a custom Table View Cell is created as prototype. Data input is limited to textfields and the default photo picker. NSCoding is used as the method for data persist.
