# scuba-app
A simple dive log app

This app uses the Foodtracker app template (Apple's "Getting Started" tutorial for Swift) and adds additional features relevant to a scuba diving log app.

There is a basic table view containing a list of dive log entries, an editable dive log entry page, and an add entry page presented modally. Information input is limited to textfields and the deafult photo picker. NSCoding is used as the method for data persist.
